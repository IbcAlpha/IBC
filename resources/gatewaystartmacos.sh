#   Notes:
#

#   TWS_MAJOR_VRSN
#
#     Specifies the major version number of Gateway to be run. If you are
#     unsure of which version number to use, run Gateway manually from the
#     icon on the desktop, then click Help > About IB Gateway. In the
#     displayed information you'll see a line similar to this:
#
#       Build 10.19.1f, Oct 28, 2022 3:03:08 PM
#
#     The major version number is 10.19. (Note that this is different from
#     the equivalent Windows and Linux settings because the macOS installer
#     includes the period in the install folder name).

#
#     Do not include the rest of the version number in this setting.


#   IBC_INI
#
#     This is the location and filename of the IBC configuration file.
#     This file should be in a folder in your personal filestore, so that
#     other users of your computer can't access it. This folder and its
#     contents should also be encrypted so that even users with administrator
#     privileges can't see the contents. Note that you can use the HOMEPATH
#     environment variable to address the root of your personal filestore
#     (HOMEPATH is set automatically by Windows).


#   TRADING_MODE
#
#     This indicates whether the live account or the paper trading account
#     corresponding to the supplied credentials is to be used. The values
#     allowed here are 'live' and 'paper' (not case-sensitive). For earlier
#     versions of TWS, setting this has no effect. If no value is specified
#     here, the value is taken from the TradingMode setting in the
#     configuration file. If no value is specified there either, the value
#     'live' is assumed.


#   TWOFA_TIMEOUT_ACTION
#
#     If you use the IBKR Mobile app for second factor authentication, and
#     after you acknowledge the alert login fails to proceed, this
#     setting determines what action will occur. If you set it to 'restart',
#     IBC will be automatically restarted and the authentication sequence
#     will be repeated, giving you another opportunity to complete the login.
#     If you set it to 'exit', IBC will simply terminate.
#
#     Note that if you have another automated mechanism (such as crontab)
#     to periodically restart IBC, you should set this to 'exit'.
#
#     Note also that if you set this to 'restart', you must also set 
#     ReloginAfterSecondFactorAuthenticationTimeout=yes in your config.ini file.


#   IBC_PATH
#
#     The folder containing the IBC files.


#   TWS_PATH
#
#     The folder where Gateway is installed. The Gateway installer always
#     installs to ~/Applications. Note that even if you have installed from a
#     Gateway download rather than a TWS download, you should still use this
#     default setting. It is possibe to move the TWS installation to a
#     different folder, but there are virtually no good reasons for doing so.


#   TWS_SETTINGS_PATH
#
#     The folder where TWS is to store its settings. By default it uses the
#     folder specified in TWS_PATH.
#
#     Is is also possible to specify this folder via the IbDir setting in
#     the configuration file. If TWS is set to auto-restart each day
#     (ie without having to log in again each time), then you must specify
#     the settings folder here rather than via IbDir: this means that these
#     two settings must either be identical, or the IbDir setting must be
#     left unset. If they are different, auto-restart will fail.
#
#     The recommended approach is to NOT use the IbDir setting in the
#     configuration file. 
#
#     Note that if multiple IB accounts are used such as live and paper
#     accounts for the same user, or accounts for different users), then
#     they should either each have a unique settings folder, or autorestart
#     must be configured to occur at a different time for each account:
#     concurrent auto-restarts may interferec and not succeed. You could
#     achieve this, for example, by having different versions of this file
#     for different users.


#   LOG_PATH
#
#     Specifies the folder where diagnostic information is to be logged while
#     this command file is running. This information is very valuable when
#     troubleshooting problems, so it is advisable to always have this set to
#     a valid location, especially when setting up IBC. You must
#     have write access to the specified folder.
#
#     If no value is set, log information is sent to the terminal window.
#
#     If the setting is removed entirely (or commented out), no log information
#     is captured at all (but this is not recommended).


#   TWSUSERID
#   TWSPASSWORD
#
#     If your TWS user id and password are not included in your IBC
#     configuration file, you can set them here. However you are strongly
#     advised not to set them here because this file is not normally in a
#     protected location.


#   FIXUSERID
#   FIXPASSWORD
#
#     If you are running the FIX Gateway (for which you must set FIX=yes in
#     your IBC configuration file), and the FIX user id and password
#     are not included in the configuration file, you can set them here.
#     However you are strongly advised not to set them here because this file
#     is not normally in a protected location.


#   JAVA_PATH
#
#     IB's installer for TWS/Gateway includes a hidden version of Java which
#     IB have used to develop and test that particular version. This means that
#     it is not necessary to separately install Java. If there is a separate
#     Java installation, that does not matter: it won't be used by IBC
#     or TWS/Gateway unless you set the path to it here. You should not do this
#     without a very good reason.
