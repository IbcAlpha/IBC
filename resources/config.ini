# Note that in the comments in this file, TWS refers to both the Trader
# Workstation and the IB Gateway, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
#
# When referred to below, the default value for a setting is the value
# assumed if either the setting is included but no value is specified, or
# the setting is not included at all.
#
# IBC may also be used to start the FIX CTCI Gateway. All settings
# relating to this have names prefixed with FIX.
#
# The IB API Gateway and the FIX CTCI Gateway share the same code. Which
# gateway actually runs is governed by an option on the initial gateway
# login screen. The FIX setting described under IBC Startup
# Settings below controls this.



# =============================================================================
# 1.   IBC Startup Settings
# =============================================================================


# IBC may be used to start the IB Gateway for the FIX CTCI. This
# setting must be set to 'yes' if you want to run the FIX CTCI gateway. The
# default is 'no'.

FIX=no



# =============================================================================
# 2.   Authentication Settings
# =============================================================================

# TWS and the IB API gateway require a single username and password.
# You may specify the username and password using the following settings:
#
#	IbLoginId
#	IbPassword
#
# Alternatively, you can specify the username and password in the command
# files used to start TWS or the Gateway, but this is not recommended for
# security reasons.
#
# If you don't specify them, you will be prompted for them in the usual
# login dialog when TWS starts (but whatever you have specified will be
# included in the dialog automatically: for example you may specify the
# username but not the password, and then you will be prompted for the
# password via the login dialog). Note that if you specify either
# the username or the password (or both) in the command file, then
# IbLoginId and IbPassword settings defined in this file are ignored.
#
#
# The FIX CTCI gateway requires one username and password for FIX order
# routing, and optionally a separate username and password for market
# data connections. You may specify the usernames and passwords using
# the following settings:
#
#	FIXLoginId
#	FIXPassword
#	IbLoginId	(optional - for market data connections)
#	IbPassword	(optional - for market data connections)
#
# Alternatively you can specify the FIX username and password in the
# command file used to start the FIX CTCI Gateway, but this is not
# recommended for security reasons.
#
# If you don't specify them, you will be prompted for them in the usual
# login dialog when FIX CTCI gateway starts (but whatever you have
# specified will be included in the dialog automatically: for example
# you may specify the usernames but not the passwords, and then you will
# be prompted for the passwords via the login dialog). Note that if you
# specify either the FIX username or the FIX password (or both) on the
# command line, then FIXLoginId and FIXPassword settings defined in this
# file are ignored; he same applies to the market data username and
# password.

# IB API Authentication Settings
# ------------------------------

# Your TWS username:

IbLoginId=edemo


# Your TWS password:

IbPassword=demouser


# FIX CTCI Authentication Settings
# --------------------------------

# Your FIX CTCI username:

FIXLoginId=


# Your FIX CTCI password:

FIXPassword=


# Second Factor Authentication Timeout Settings
# ---------------------------------------------
#
# If you use the IBKR Mobile app for second factor authentication,
# and you fail to complete the process before the time limit imposed
# by IBKR, you can use this setting to tell IBC to exit: arrangements
# can then be made to automatically restart IBC in order to initiate
# the login sequence afresh. Otherwise, manual intervention at TWS's
# Second Factor Authentication dialog is needed to complete the
# login.
#
# Permitted values are 'yes' and 'no'. The default is 'no'.
#
# Note that the scripts provided with the IBC zips for Windows and
# Linux provide options to automatically restart in these
# circumstances, but only if this setting is also set to 'yes'.

ExitAfterSecondFactorAuthenticationTimeout=no


# This setting is only relevant if
# ExitAfterSecondFactorAuthenticationTimeout is set to 'yes'.
#
# It controls how long (in seconds) IBC waits for login to complete
# after the user acknowledges the second factor authentication
# alert at the IBKR Mobile app. If login has not completed after
# this time, IBC terminates.
# The default value is 40.

SecondFactorAuthenticationExitInterval=


# Trading Mode
# ------------
#
# TWS 955 introduced a new Trading Mode combo box on its login
# dialog. This indicates whether the live account or the paper
# trading account corresponding to the supplied credentials is
# to be used. The allowed values are 'live' (the default) and
# 'paper'. For earlier versions of TWS this setting has no
# effect.

TradingMode=live


# Paper-trading Account Warning
# -----------------------------
#
# Logging in to a paper-trading account results in TWS displaying
# a dialog asking the user to confirm that they are aware that this
# is not a brokerage account. Until this dialog has been accepted,
# TWS will not allow API connections to succeed. Setting this
# to 'yes' (the default) will cause IBC to automatically
# confirm acceptance. Setting it to 'no' will leave the dialog
# on display, and the user will have to deal with it manually.

AcceptNonBrokerageAccountWarning=no


# Login Dialog Display Timeout
#-----------------------------
#
# In some circumstances, starting TWS may result in failure to display
# the login dialog. Restarting TWS may help to resolve this situation,
# and IBC does this automatically.
#
# This setting controls how long (in seconds) IBC waits for the login
# dialog to appear before restarting TWS.
#
# Note that in normal circumstances with a reasonably specified 
# computer the time to displaying the login dialog is typically less
# than 20 seconds, and frequently much less. However many factors can
# influence this, and it is unwise to set this value too low.
#
# The default value is 60.

LoginDialogDisplayTimeout = 60



# =============================================================================
# 3.   TWS Startup Settings
# =============================================================================

# Path to settings store
# ----------------------
#
# Path to the directory where TWS should store its settings. This is
# normally the folder in which TWS is installed. However you may set
# it to some other location if you wish (for example if you want to
# run multiple instances of TWS with different settings).
#
# It is recommended for clarity that you use an absolute path. The
# effect of using a relative path is undefined.
#
# Linux and macOS users should use the appropriate path syntax.
#
# Note that, for Windows users, you MUST use double separator
# characters to separate the elements of the folder path: for
# example, IbDir=C:\\IBLiveSettings is valid, but
# IbDir=C:\IBLiveSettings is NOT valid and will give unexpected
# results. Linux and macOS users need not use double separators,
# but they are acceptable.
#
# The default is the current working directory when IBC is
# started.

IbDir=


# Store settings on server
# ------------------------
#
# If you wish to store a copy of your TWS settings on IB's
# servers as well as locally on your computer, set this to
# 'yes': this enables you to run TWS on different computers
# with the same configuration, market data lines, etc. If set
# to 'no', running TWS on different computers will not share the
# same settings. If no value is specified, TWS will obtain its
# settings from the same place as the last time this user logged
# in (whether manually or using IBC).

StoreSettingsOnServer=


# Minimize TWS on startup
# -----------------------
#
# Set to 'yes' to minimize TWS when it starts:

MinimizeMainWindow=no


# Existing Session Detected Action
# --------------------------------
#
# When a user logs on to an IBKR account for trading purposes by any means, the
# IBKR account server checks to see whether the account is already logged in
# elsewhere. If so, a dialog is displayed to both the users that enables them
# to determine what happens next. The 'ExistingSessionDetectedAction' setting
# instructs TWS how to proceed when it displays this dialog:
#
#   * If the new TWS session is set to 'secondary', the existing session continues
#     and the new session terminates. Thus a secondary TWS session can never
#     override any other session.
#
#   * If the existing TWS session is set to 'primary', the existing session
#     continues and the new session terminates (even if the new session is also
#     set to primary). Thus a primary TWS session can never be overridden by
#     any new session).
#
#   * If both the existing and the new TWS sessions are set to 'primaryoverride',
#     the existing session terminates and the new session proceeds.
#
#   * If the existing TWS session is set to 'manual', the user must handle the
#     dialog.
#
# The difference between 'primary' and 'primaryoverride' is that a
# 'primaryoverride' session can be overriden over by a new 'primary' session,
# but a 'primary' session cannot be overriden by any other session.
#
# When set to 'primary', if another TWS session is started and manually told to
# end the 'primary' session, the 'primary' session is automatically reconnected.
#
# The default is 'manual'.

ExistingSessionDetectedAction=manual


# Override TWS API Port Number
# ----------------------------
#
# If OverrideTwsApiPort is set to an integer, IBC changes the
# 'Socket port' in TWS's API configuration to that number shortly
# after startup. Leaving the setting blank will make no change to
# the current setting. This setting is only intended for use in
# certain specialized situations where the port number needs to
# be set dynamically at run-time: most users will never need it,
# so don't use it unless you know you need it.

OverrideTwsApiPort=


# Read-only Login
# ---------------
#
# If ReadOnlyLogin is set to 'yes', and the user is enrolled in IB's
# account security programme, the user will not be asked to perform
# the second factor authentication action, and login to TWS will
# occur automatically in read-only mode: in this mode, placing or
# managing orders is not allowed. If set to 'no', and the user is
# enrolled in IB's account security programme, the user must perform
# the relevant second factor authentication action to complete the
# login. 

# If the user is not enrolled in IB's account security programme,
# this setting is ignored. The default is 'no'.

ReadOnlyLogin=no


# Read-only API
# -------------
#
# If ReadOnlyApi is set to 'yes', API programs cannot submit, modify
# or cancel orders. If set to 'no', API programs can do these things.
# If not set, the existing TWS/Gateway configuration is unchanged.
# NB: this setting is really only supplied for the benefit of new TWS
# or Gateway instances that are being automatically installed and
# started without user intervention (eg Docker containers). Where
# a user is involved, they should use the Global Configuration to
# set the relevant checkbox (this only needs to be done once) and
# not provide a value for this setting.

ReadOnlyApi=


# Market data size for US stocks - lots or shares
# -----------------------------------------------
#
# Since IB introduced the option of market data for US stocks showing
# bid, ask and last sizes in shares rather than lots, TWS and Gateway
# display a dialog immediately after login notifying the user about
# this and requiring user input before allowing market data to be
# accessed. The user can request that the dialog not be shown again.
#
# It is recommended that the user should handle this dialog manually
# rather than using these settings, which are provided for situations 
# where the user interface is not easily accessible, or where user
# settings are not preserved between sessions (eg some Docker images).
#
# - If this setting is set to 'accept', the dialog will be handled
#   automatically and the option to not show it again will be
#   selected.
#
#   Note that in this case, the only way to allow the dialog to be
#   displayed again is to manually enable the 'Bid, Ask and Last
#   Size Display Update' message in the 'Messages' section of the TWS
#   configuration dialog. So you should only use 'Accept' if you are
#   sure you really don't want the dialog to be displayed again, or
#   you have easy access to the user interface.
#
# - If set to 'defer', the dialog will be handled automatically (so
#   that market data will start), but the option to not show it again
#   will not be selected, and it will be shown again after the next
#   login.
#
# - If set to 'ignore', the user has to deal with the dialog manually.
#
# The default value is 'ignore'.
#
# Note if set to 'accept' or 'defer', TWS also automatically sets
# the API settings checkbox labelled 'Send market data in lots for
# US stocks for dual-mode API clients'. IBC cannot prevent this.
# However you can change this immmediately by setting
# SendMarketDataInLotsForUSstocks (see below) to 'no' .

AcceptBidAskLastSizeDisplayUpdateNotification=


# This setting determines whether the API settings checkbox labelled
# 'Send market data in lots for US stocks for dual-mode API clients'
# is set or cleared. If set to 'yes', the checkbox is set. If set to
# 'no' the checkbox is cleared. If defaulted, the checkbox is
# unchanged.

SendMarketDataInLotsForUSstocks=



# =============================================================================
# 4.   TWS Auto-Closedown
# =============================================================================
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: Starting with TWS 974, this setting no longer
# works properly, because IB have changed the way TWS handles its
# autologoff mechanism. 
#
# You should now configure the TWS autologoff time to something
# convenient for you, and restart IBC each day.
#
# Alternatively, discontinue use of IBC and use the auto-relogin
# mechanism within TWS 974 and later versions (note that the 
# auto-relogin mechanism provided by IB is not available if you
# use IBC).

# Set to yes or no (lower case).
#
#   yes   means allow TWS to shut down automatically at its
# 	  specified shutdown time, which is set via the TWS
#	  configuration menu.
#
#   no    means TWS never shuts down automatically.
#
# NB: IB recommends that you do not keep TWS running
# continuously. If you set this setting to 'no', you may
# experience incorrect TWS operation.
#
# NB: the default for this setting is 'no'. Since this will
# only work properly with TWS versions earlier than 974, you
# should explicitly set this to 'yes' for version 974 and later.

IbAutoClosedown=yes



# =============================================================================
# 5.   TWS Tidy Closedown Time
# =============================================================================
#
# NB: starting with TWS 974 this is no longer a useful option
# because both TWS and Gateway now have the same auto-logoff
# mechanism, and IBC can no longer avoid this.
#
# Note that giving this setting a value does not change TWS's
# auto-logoff in any way: any setting will be additional to the
# TWS auto-logoff.
#
# To tell IBC to tidily close TWS at a specified time every
# day, set this value to <hh:mm>, for example:
# ClosedownAt=22:00
#
# To tell IBC to tidily close TWS at a specified day and time
# each week, set this value to <dayOfWeek hh:mm>, for example:
# ClosedownAt=Friday 22:00
#
# Note that the day of the week must be specified using your
# default locale. Also note that Java will only accept
# characters encoded to ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1). This means that
# if the day name in your default locale uses any non-Latin-1
# characters you need to encode them using Unicode escapes
# (see http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/lexical.html#3.3
# for details). For example, to tidily close TWS at 12:00 on
# Saturday where the default locale is Simplified Chinese,
# use the following:
# #ClosedownAt=\u661F\u671F\u516D 12:00

ClosedownAt=



# =============================================================================
# 6.   Other TWS Settings
# =============================================================================

# Accept Incoming Connection
# --------------------------
#
# If set to 'accept', IBC automatically accepts incoming
# API connection dialogs. If set to 'reject', IBC
# automatically rejects incoming API connection dialogs. If
# set to 'manual', the user must decide whether to accept or reject
# incoming API connection dialogs. The default is 'manual'.
# NB: it is recommended to set this to 'reject', and to explicitly
# configure which IP addresses can connect to the API in TWS's API
# configuration page, as this is much more secure (in this case, no
# incoming API connection dialogs will occur for those IP addresses).

AcceptIncomingConnectionAction=manual


# Allow Blind Trading
# -------------------
#
# If you attempt to place an order for a contract for which
# you have no market data subscription, TWS displays a dialog
# to warn you against such blind trading.
#
#   yes   means the dialog is dismissed as though the user had
# 	  clicked the 'Ok' button: this means that you accept
# 	  the risk and want the order to be submitted.
#
#   no    means the dialog remains on display and must be
#         handled by the user.

AllowBlindTrading=no


# Save Settings on a Schedule
# ---------------------------
#
# You can tell TWS to automatically save its settings on a schedule
# of your choosing. You can specify one or more specific times,
# like this:
#
# SaveTwsSettingsAt=HH:MM [ HH:MM]...
#
# for example:
# SaveTwsSettingsAt=08:00   12:30 17:30
#
# Or you can specify an interval at which settings are to be saved,
# optionally starting at a specific time and continuing until another
# time, like this:
#
#SaveTwsSettingsAt=Every n [{mins | hours}] [hh:mm] [hh:mm]
#
# where the first hh:mm is the start time and the second is the end
# time. If you don't specify the end time, settings are saved regularly
# from the start time till midnight. If you don't specify the start time.
# settings are saved regularly all day, beginning at 00:00. Note that
# settings will always be saved at the end time, even if that is not
# exactly one interval later than the previous time. If neither 'mins'
# nor 'hours' is specified, 'mins' is assumed. Examples:
#
# To save every 30 minutes all day starting at 00:00
#SaveTwsSettingsAt=Every 30
#SaveTwsSettingsAt=Every 30 mins
#
# To save every hour starting at 08:00 and ending at midnight
#SaveTwsSettingsAt=Every 1 hours 08:00
#SaveTwsSettingsAt=Every 1 hours 08:00 00:00
#
# To save every 90 minutes starting at 08:00 up to and including 17:43
#SaveTwsSettingsAt=Every 90 08:00 17:43

SaveTwsSettingsAt=



# =============================================================================
# 7.   Settings Specific to Indian Versions of TWS
# =============================================================================

# Indian versions of TWS may display a password expiry
# notification dialog and a NSE Compliance dialog. These can be
# dismissed by setting the following to yes. By default the
# password expiry notice is not dismissed, but the NSE Compliance
# notice is dismissed.

# Warning: setting DismissPasswordExpiryWarning=yes will mean
# you will not be notified when your password is about to expire.
# You must then take other measures to ensure that your password
# is changed within the expiry period, otherwise IBC will
# not be able to login successfully.

DismissPasswordExpiryWarning=no
DismissNSEComplianceNotice=yes



# =============================================================================
# 8.   IBC Command Server Settings
# =============================================================================

# Do NOT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING SETTINGS unless you
# intend to issue commands to IBC (for example
# using telnet). Note that these settings have nothing to
# do with running programs that use the TWS API.

# Command Server Port Number
# --------------------------
#
# The port number that IBC listens on for commands
# such as "STOP". DO NOT set this to the port number
# used for TWS API connections. There is no good reason
# to change this setting unless the port is used by
# some other application (typically another instance of
# IBC). The default value is 0, which tells IBC not to
# start the command server

#CommandServerPort=7462


# Permitted Command Sources
# -------------------------
#
# A comma separated list of IP addresses, or host names,
# which are allowed addresses for sending commands to
# IBC.  Commands can always be sent from the
# same host as IBC is running on.

ControlFrom=


# Address for Receiving Commands
# ------------------------------
#
# Specifies the IP address on which the Command Server
# is to listen. For a multi-homed host, this can be used
# to specify that connection requests are only to be
# accepted on the specified address. The default is to
# accept connection requests on all local addresses.

BindAddress=


# Command Prompt
# --------------
#
# The specified string is output by the server when
# the connection is first opened and after the completion
# of each command. This can be useful if sending commands
# using an interactive program such as telnet. The default
# is that no prompt is output.
# For example:
#
# CommandPrompt=>

CommandPrompt=


# Suppress Command Server Info Messages
# -------------------------------------
#
# Some commands can return intermediate information about
# their progress. This setting controls whether such
# information is sent. The default is that such information
# is not sent.

SuppressInfoMessages=yes



# =============================================================================
# 9.   Diagnostic Settings
# =============================================================================
#
# IBC can log information about the structure of windows
# displayed by TWS. This information is useful when adding
# new features to IBC or when behaviour is not as expected. 
#
# The logged information shows the hierarchical organisation
# of all the components of the window, and includes the
# current values of text boxes and labels.
#
# Note that this structure logging has a small performance
# impact, and depending on the settings can cause the logfile
# size to be significantly increased. It is therefore
# recommended that the LogStructureWhen setting be set to
# 'never' (the default) unless there is a specific reason
# that this information is needed.


# Scope of Structure Logging
# --------------------------
#
# The LogStructureScope setting indicates which windows are
# eligible for structure logging:
#
#    - if set to 'known', only windows that IBC recognizes
#      are eligible - these are windows that IBC has some
#      interest in monitoring, usually to take some action
#      on the user's behalf;
#
#    - if set to 'unknown', only windows that IBC does not
#      recognize are eligible. Most windows displayed by
#      TWS fall into this category;
#
#    - if set to 'untitled', only windows that IBC does not
#      recognize and that have no title are eligible. These
#      are usually message boxes or similar small windows,
#
#    - if set to 'all', then every window displayed by TWS
#      is eligible.
#
# The default value is 'known'.

LogStructureScope=known


# When to Log Window Structure
# ----------------------------
#
# The LogStructureWhen setting specifies the circumstances
# when eligible TWS windows have their structure logged:
#
#     - if set to 'open' or 'yes' or 'true', IBC logs the
#       structure of an eligible window the first time it
#       is encountered;
#
#    - if set to 'activate', the structure is logged every
#      time an eligible window is made active;
#
#    - if set to 'never' or 'no' or 'false', structure
#      information is never logged.
#
# The default value is 'never'.

LogStructureWhen=never


# DEPRECATED SETTING
# ------------------
#
# LogComponents - THIS SETTING WILL BE REMOVED IN A FUTURE
# RELEASE
#
# If LogComponents is set to any value, this is equivalent
# to setting LogStructureWhen to that same value and
# LogStructureScope to 'all': the actual values of those
# settings are ignored. The default is that the values
# of LogStructureScope and LogStructureWhen are honoured.

#LogComponents=
